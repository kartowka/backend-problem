## Cloud Architecture

Imagine that one day this service will have to be scaled to handle millions of interrupts
per day. Please explain how you would expand this system and how you would create it
in a cloud architecture. Additionally provide a diagram visualizing your architecture.

This section is theoretical only and does not require code.

## Answers

- Load balancing: We can use load balancers to distribute the incoming requests across multiple servers. This helps to avoid overloading a single server and ensures that the requests are processed efficiently.
- Caching: We can implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for repeated database queries. This helps to improve the response time and reduce the load on the database.
- Scaling the database: We can use techniques such as sharding and replication to scale the database. Sharding involves partitioning the data across multiple servers, while replication involves creating copies of the database on multiple servers. This helps to distribute the load and ensure that the system remains highly available.
- Implementing a message queue: We can use a message queue to handle requests asynchronously. This allows us to decouple the request processing from the client's response, which helps to improve the performance and scalability of the system.
- Using a cloud provider: We can leverage the services provided by cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. These services provide scalable infrastructure, storage, and networking solutions that can help us to build highly scalable systems.
- Auto-scaling: We can configure the infrastructure to automatically scale up or down based on the traffic load. This ensures that the system is always available and responsive.

#### Here is a diagram that illustrates a possible architecture for the scalable interrupt handling service:

```
+--------------------------------+
|         Load Balancer          |
+--------------------------------+
          |         |
          |         |
+---------+         +---------+
|      Server 1      Server 2 |
+-----------------------------+
|           Database           |
+-----------------------------+
```

- In this architecture, the load balancer receives incoming requests and distributes them across multiple servers. Each server processes the requests independently, and the load is distributed across the servers to ensure optimal performance. The servers interact with a central database that stores the data. The database is replicated across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability. The architecture can be extended to include caching mechanisms, message queues, and other scalability techniques to further improve performance and scalability.
